# Home Office Setup for Typing Efficiency

A comfortable home office boosts typing speed and reduces fatigue. Follow these ergonomic tips while using the **Lessons** page:

- **Chair**: Adjust height so your feet rest flat on the floor.
- **Monitor**: Top of screen at eye level; keep it about an arm's length away.
- **Keyboard**: Keep wrists straight; consider a split ergonomic keyboard.
- **Breaks**: Follow the 20‑20‑20 rule – every 20 min, look 20 ft away for 20 seconds.
