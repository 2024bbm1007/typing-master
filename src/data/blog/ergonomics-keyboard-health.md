# Keyboard Ergonomics: Protecting Your Hands for a Lifetime of Typing

The average office worker types over 40 hours per week. That's 2,000+ hours annually of repetitive finger, hand, and wrist movements. Without proper ergonomics, this volume can lead to discomfort, pain, and serious conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome or tendinitis.

The good news? With the right setup and habits, you can type comfortably and injury-free for your entire career.

## Understanding Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI)

RSI is an umbrella term for injuries caused by repetitive motions. Common typing-related conditions include:

### Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Compression of the median nerve in the wrist, causing numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand.

**Warning signs:**
- Numbness in thumb, index, and middle fingers
- Pain that worsens at night
- Weakness when gripping objects
- "Electric shock" sensations in fingers

### Tendinitis
Inflammation of the tendons, often in the wrist or forearm.

**Warning signs:**
- Pain during or after typing
- Swelling or warmth in affected area
- Stiffness, especially in the morning
- Grinding sensation when moving the joint

### De Quervain's Tenosynovitis
Inflammation of tendons on the thumb side of the wrist.

**Warning signs:**
- Pain when making a fist or gripping
- Swelling near the base of the thumb
- Difficulty moving thumb and wrist

## The Ergonomic Workstation

### Chair Setup

Your chair is the foundation of good posture.

**Height**: Adjust so your thighs are parallel to the floor, feet flat (use a footrest if needed).

**Backrest**: Should support the natural curve of your lower back. Consider a lumbar cushion if your chair lacks built-in support.

**Armrests**: Position so your shoulders remain relaxed, elbows at roughly 90 degrees.

### Desk Height

Your desk should allow:
- Forearms parallel to the floor when typing
- No reaching up or hunching down to the keyboard
- Space for your mouse at the same level as your keyboard

**Tip**: If your desk isn't adjustable, raise your chair and add a footrest—it's easier than modifying the desk.

### Monitor Position

- **Distance**: Arm's length away (20-26 inches)
- **Height**: Top of screen at or slightly below eye level
- **Angle**: Tilted slightly upward (10-20 degrees)

This prevents neck strain from looking down and reduces eye fatigue.

### Keyboard Placement

Your keyboard should be:
- Directly in front of you, centered on the most-used keys (letters, not the number pad)
- At a height where your forearms are parallel to the floor
- Flat or with a slight negative tilt (front edge raised)—*not* propped up on the rear legs

**Why flat?** Raised keyboard backs force wrist extension, increasing pressure on the carpal tunnel.

### Mouse Position

- Immediately beside the keyboard, same height
- Close enough that you don't reach or stretch
- Consider a vertical mouse or trackball if you experience wrist pain

## Proper Typing Posture

### The Neutral Position

The goal is "neutral"—joints in natural, relaxed positions.

**Wrists**: Straight, not angled up, down, or to the sides. Imagine a straight line from forearm through knuckles.

**Fingers**: Curved naturally, like holding a ball or resting on a table.

**Shoulders**: Relaxed and down, not hunched or raised.

**Back**: Straight but not rigid, maintaining natural spinal curves.

### Common Posture Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Wrist extension | Compresses carpal tunnel | Lower keyboard, use wrist rest only when pausing |
| Wrist deviation | Strains tendons | Center keyboard, keep movements minimal |
| Hunched shoulders | Neck and upper back pain | Check monitor height, relax shoulders |
| Leaning forward | Lower back strain | Move monitor closer, sit back |
| Typing heavy | Unnecessary force strains joints | Use light, fluid keystrokes |

### Wrist Rests: Friend or Foe?

Wrist rests are **for resting between typing**, not during. Resting on a pad while actively typing forces your wrists into extension and adds pressure.

**Correct use**: Pause, rest palms on pad, then return to floating position when typing resumes.

## Essential Equipment

### Ergonomic Keyboards

Several designs address ergonomic concerns:

**Split keyboards**: Separate the key sections, allowing natural arm and wrist angles.

**Curved/contoured keyboards**: Create a "wave" that follows natural finger positioning.

**Ortholinear keyboards**: Arrange keys in straight columns rather than staggered rows.

### Keyboard Tenting

Tilting the keyboard halves outward (like a tent) can reduce forearm pronation. Some ergonomic keyboards include built-in tenting.

### Mechanical vs. Membrane

Mechanical keyboards provide:
- Consistent key feel
- Lighter actuation force (less impact per keystroke)
- Tactile and/or audible feedback (reducing "bottoming out")

For heavy typists, mechanical switches rated around 45-50g of actuation force are generally comfortable.

## Breaks and Movement

### The 20-20-20 Rule

Every 20 minutes:
- Look at something 20 feet away
- For 20 seconds

This reduces eye strain and prompts posture check-ins.

### Microbreaks

Every 30-60 minutes, take a 2-5 minute break to:
- Stand and stretch
- Walk briefly
- Shake out your hands
- Roll your shoulders

### Stretches for Typists

Perform these stretches gently—never to the point of pain.

**Wrist Flexor Stretch**
1. Extend your arm, palm up
2. With the other hand, gently pull fingers back toward your body
3. Hold 15-30 seconds, repeat 2-3 times each side

**Wrist Extensor Stretch**
1. Extend your arm, palm down
2. With the other hand, gently press the back of your hand toward your body
3. Hold 15-30 seconds, repeat 2-3 times each side

**Finger Spreads**
1. Spread fingers wide, hold 5 seconds
2. Make a fist, hold 5 seconds
3. Repeat 10 times

**Neck Rolls**
1. Drop chin to chest
2. Slowly roll head to the right, then back, then left
3. Complete 5 circles, then reverse direction

**Shoulder Shrugs**
1. Raise shoulders toward ears
2. Hold 5 seconds
3. Release and relax
4. Repeat 10 times

## Warning Signs: When to Seek Help

Don't ignore persistent symptoms. See a healthcare professional if you experience:

- Pain lasting more than a few days
- Numbness or tingling that doesn't resolve with rest
- Weakness in hands or fingers
- Visible swelling
- Symptoms that worsen over time

Early intervention is crucial—many RSI conditions are much easier to treat in early stages.

## Building Sustainable Habits

### Start Today

1. **Audit your workstation**: Check chair, desk, keyboard, and monitor positions.
2. **Set break reminders**: Use apps or timers to prompt regular movement.
3. **Learn the stretches**: Practice them now so they become routine.
4. **Monitor your body**: Pay attention to early warning signs.

### Long-Term Strategies

- Vary your tasks to avoid hours of continuous typing
- Consider voice dictation for drafts or emails
- Strengthen your hands and forearms with general exercise
- Stay hydrated—it supports connective tissue health

## The Bigger Picture

Keyboard ergonomics isn't just about avoiding injury—it's about sustainable performance. Comfortable typists are faster, more accurate, and more productive.

Your hands are irreplaceable tools. Invest in their care, and they'll serve you well for decades of typing ahead.
